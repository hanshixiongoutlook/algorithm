# Binary tree problems

## 1.Simple Traversal

> It's one of the most common problem of binary tree.

1.1 problems

depth

invert

symmetirc

same tree

find leaf



1.2 traversal method

* recursion DFS

preorder

root->left->right

postorder

left->right>root

inorder

left->root->right



* levelorder BFS



2.path operations

get all the root to leaves pathes

calculate the max sum of the path that root to leaf
