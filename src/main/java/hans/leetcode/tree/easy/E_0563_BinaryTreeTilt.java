/**
 Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of every tree node's tilt.

 The tilt of a tree node is the absolute difference between the sum of all left
 subtree node values and all right subtree node values. If a node does not have
 a left child, then the sum of the left subtree node values is treated as 0. The
 rule is similar if the node does not have a right child.


 Example 1:


 Input: root = [1,2,3]
 Output: 1
 Explanation:
 Tilt of node 2 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
 Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
 Tilt of node 1 : |2-3| = 1 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 2; right
 subtree is just right child, so sum is 3)
 Sum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 1 = 1


 Example 2:


 Input: root = [4,2,9,3,5,null,7]
 Output: 15
 Explanation:
 Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
 Tilt of node 5 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
 Tilt of node 7 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
 Tilt of node 2 : |3-5| = 2 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 3; right
 subtree is just right child, so sum is 5)
 Tilt of node 9 : |0-7| = 7 (no left child, so sum is 0; right subtree is just
 right child, so sum is 7)
 Tilt of node 4 : |(3+5+2)-(9+7)| = |10-16| = 6 (left subtree values are 3, 5,
 and 2, which sums to 10; right subtree values are 9 and 7, which sums to 16)
 Sum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 7 + 6 = 15


 Example 3:


 Input: root = [21,7,14,1,1,2,2,3,3]
 Output: 9



 Constraints:


 The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10‚Å¥].
 -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
