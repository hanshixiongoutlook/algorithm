/**
 Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the
 tree.

 According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely
 filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left
 as possible. It can have between 1 and 2 ∞ nodes inclusive at the last level h.

 Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.


 Example 1:


 Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
 Output: 6


 Example 2:


 Input: root = []
 Output: 0


 Example 3:


 Input: root = [1]
 Output: 1



 Constraints:


 The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5 * 10‚Å¥].
 0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 10‚Å¥
 The tree is guaranteed to be complete.
